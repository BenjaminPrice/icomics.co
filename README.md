# iComics.co Site Source Code
#### The official iComics website! In source code form!

## What is this?

This is all of the source code behind the [official website](http://icomics.co) for my iOS app, iComics.
I've open-sourced it, mainly for the ability to keep a version history of it (for free! Thanks GitHub!), as well as an extra backup.
The website is completely open (Hopefully that doesn't mean any exploitable security holes. XD) with anything needed to be
kept hidden (ie private API keys) inside a file named private.php.

## License

Any of the code in this website is licensed under the MIT license. Obviously please don't simply duplicate this
website and upload it anywhere else. XD
